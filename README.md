## ML in Action

High-level steps to follow in a ML project:

1. Import the data - often comes in the form of a CSV file
2. Clean the data - involves removing irrelevant, duplicate or incomplete data
3. Split the data into training/test sets - usually 80% for training the model & 20% for testing
4. Create a model - involves selecting an algorithm to analyze the data, trade-off: accuracy vs performance
5. Train the model
6. Make predictions - not always accurate
7. Evaluate predictions and improve - involves evaluating predictions and measuring their accuracy

Depending on the accuracy of predictions, we could get back to the model and:

* select a different algorithm to produce a more accurate result for our problem
* or fine-tune the parameters of a model

Each algorithm has parameters that can be modified to optimize the accuracy.
